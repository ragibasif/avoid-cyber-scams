## About

This presentation was built for [CSPSC](https://cspsc-hacks.devpost.com/)
hackathon. It aims to give senior citizens, or anyone unfamiliar with protecting
themselves against cyber scams, a rudimentary introduction. It is not meant to
be a comprehensive list of methods. It is intended to be an easy-to-understand
and easy-to-follow general guide.
